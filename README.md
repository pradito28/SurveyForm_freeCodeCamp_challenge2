# SurveyForm_freeCodeCamp_challenge2
HTML &amp; CSS code for the Survey Form, challenge number 2 from FreeCodeAcademy.

IÂ´ve learnt to set the different elements into the website through HTML and how to format them with CSS+
including different type of elements from a survey as radio and checkboxes, text-box, and small images.

To improve: I found quite difficult to understand how to situate each element where I want. I still have to practice the position attributes and the react of the page when is expanded in the browser. For example, how to align the pictures with the radios and labels.
